ARRAY
For my next topic, I'll be discussing Arrays in C
An array is a data structure of data of same data type stored in sequential form

DEFINTION AND DECLARATION
Arrays are defined in the following format:
Data_type  Array_name[Size of Array]

LENGTH OF ARRAY
It is important to note that the length or size of an array can only a positive integer. It can't be a negative integer.

ACCESSING ARRAYS
We can access or navigate our arrays using the indexing method.
Example:
We have an array in the form below:

Int arr[5];
Accessing this array with the indexing method means we'll start from 0-4
arr[0] = First element in the array
arr[4] = Last element in the array
